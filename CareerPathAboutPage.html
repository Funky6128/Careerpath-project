		<p>My name is Aaron Funk, and I am 24 years old. My motivation for making this app comes from my personal life. After graduating high school, 
		I worked full time for a few years to figure out what I wanted to do. Having an app where I could share my interests and be shown career paths 
		that fall in line with those interests would have been a very helpful tool. That is not my only motivation, the other part of my motivation comes
		from where I stand now. I am currently enrolled in an associate program for computer technology, there are a lot of different paths to choose from
		in the technology field and some of the paths I didnâ€™t know existed. To have a tool like this for me as a student interested in the tech field would
		be a great way to see all my options and really narrow down on which path I would like to pursue.</p><br>
