		<h2>What is this app all about?</h2>
		<p>The application “Career Path Finder” will focus on helping individuals who are moving into a career field select a path that fits them, interact with people on the same journey as them, 
		as well as interact with professionals in the field to help with networking. The purpose of this application is to use discussions that lay out paths in a career field of the user’s choice 
		to give them a visual of all the options they have available to them in their desired field. This app is also aimed at being a social space where users can interact with others who are on 
		the same path as them. I also want professionals in the field to connect with users on this app to help share ideas, give tips, and allow beginners to start networking. Along with discussion 
		boards the app will also offer free educational tools to help users with an interest in a specific field to get more information and start learning before they step foot in a job.</p><br>

		<h2>How we can keep this community a safe place</h2>
		<p>First and most importantly is to treat everyone who you interact with on this site with respect. There will be users of all different ages, race, and ethnicity coming to this site to try 
		and better themselves by finding a career path, a mentor, or some information on the career of their dreams. No matter how knowledgeable someone is on a career never make them feel lesser than
		someone else, be encouraged to help each other grow and learn. Lastly keep all discussion posts family friendly, any vulgar language will not be tolerated because I want everyone to be able to
		enjoy this application, feel safe using it, and get the most fulfilling experience possible out of it.</p><br>
